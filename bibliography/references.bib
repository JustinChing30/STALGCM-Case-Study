 @article{Stabler_2004, title={Varieties of crossing dependencies: structure dependence and mild context sensitivity}, volume={28}, DOI={10.1207/s15516709cog2805_4}, abstractNote={<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Four different kinds of grammars that can define crossing dependencies in human language are compared here: (i) context sensitive rewrite grammars with rules that depend on context, (ii) matching grammars with constraints that filter the generative structure of the language, (iii) copying grammars which can copy structures of unbounded size, and (iv) generating grammars in which crossing dependencies are generated from a finite lexical basis. Context sensitive rewrite grammars are syntactically, semantically and computationally unattractive. Generating grammars have a collection of nice properties that ensure they define only “mildly context sensitive” languages, and Joshi has proposed that human languages have those properties too. But for certain distinctive kinds of crossing dependencies in human languages, copying or matching analyses predominate. Some results relevant to the viability of mildly context sensitive analyses and some open questions are reviewed.</jats:p>}, number={5}, journal={Cognitive Science}, publisher={Wiley}, author={Stabler, Edward P.}, year={2004}, month=sep, pages={699–720}, language={en} }

We computationally classify theories of reduplication using a hierarchy of string-to-string function classes. Reduplication as a process requires only the regular class of functions. We show that various morphological theories necessarily treat it as a more expressive polyregular function, while others maintain regularity. We discuss the significance of this formal result for reduplicative functions and recognition.</jats:p>}, number={1}, journal={Glossa: a journal of general linguistics}, publisher={Open Library of the Humanities}, author={Rawski, Jonathan and Dolatian, Hossep and Heinz, Jeffrey and Raimy, Eric}, year={2023}, month=jan }
